# Shiba Runner 🐕

🚧 **Work in Progress** 🚧  

Shiba Runner is a small endless runner game I’m building in Godot.  
The idea is simple: you play as a Shiba dog running endlessly, jumping over obstacles, and surviving as long as you can.  

## Why I’m Making This
I’m building this game to:
- Learn and practice Godot game development  
- Explore game design and pixel art  
- Eventually release a fun, polished little project  

## Current Status
- Still in early development  
- Basic mechanics are being tested  
- Sprites and animations are not final  

Stay tuned for updates! 🐕💨
